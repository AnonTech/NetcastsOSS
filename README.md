## Why?

* You want an ad-free app for your podcasts consumption
* You want an app powered by open source software
* You want an app you can clone, tinker with, and add functionality to
* You want to learn more about Flutter which powers this app

## App Releases

I have not made what's required to release this app in the play store
(keys, release settings, etc) available via github.  It's essentially
what's in the flutter docs guiding developers through the release process.

## Getting Started

For help getting started with Flutter, view the official
[documentation](https://flutter.io/).
